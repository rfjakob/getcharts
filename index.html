<h1>Slow Electronics</h1>
<p>
Frontpage response times of the four biggest electronic distributors: Farnell, RS, Mouser, Digikey.
The data is gathered using essentially "curl -L -w %{time_total} $URL" and includes
DNS resolution and redirect time. You can download the raw CSV
<a href="frontpage.txt">here</a>.

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since Jul 25, 2016, the poll intervall is 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Mouser does not return a complete page if no cookies are set
(and is still a slower than Digikey). The backend seems to be written
in ASP.NET. The frontend is hosted on Akamai.</li>
<li>Farnell seems to have massive problems with its backend,
with response times up to 5 seconds. It seems to be written in Java (JSP).
The frontend is hosted on Akamai (server: AkamaiGHost).</li>
<li>Digikey's fronted is hostend on <a href="https://www.instartlogic.com/">instart</a>.
Overall, Digikey does a very good job with the lowest response times of the four.
The backend seems to be written in ASP.NET.</li>
<li>RS' backend is mediocre, with response times
up to 2 seconds. It seems to be written in Java (JSF).
The frontend is hosted on Akamai (server: AkamaiGHost).</li>
</ul>
